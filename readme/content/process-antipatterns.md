The next anti-patterns are process-oriented, rather than expectation/assumptions

- **ORPHANS** - Next actions with no courier/handler name attached to midwife their implementation.
- **LOST CAUSE** - When the facilitator is responsible for the effectiveness and outcome of the retro.
- **CONFLICT OF INTEREST** - When facilitator offers data, insights, and next actions.
- **THE BLOB** - A retro with no timebox, or that consistently exceeds its timebox, even with consent of participants.
- **TOLD YOU SO** - A retro that generates next actions that we were going to do anyway, from data and insights we already shared going in.
- **FIRE AND FORGET** - Next actions dropped because they were fundamentally uninteresting - the team agreed on them but didn't believe in them.

### Expansion on Why I Told You So is an Antipattern ###

You’ll note that I mentioned the same data and insights, meaning other options weren’t discussed, and the same action was decided upon anyway in an empty ceremony. In that case a retro is irrelevant. Retros should uncover unshared data, new insights, etc.
